### Preview

![preview](https://github.com/ve-i/vc-Boo/blob/main/preview/preview2.png)

- Orange Ghosty: indicates that you probably missed answering a question
- Other Ghosty: indicates that you are not the last one to have spoken

#### To-do (maybe)
(if ever)


- display a ghosty icon onto the "Home"/"Direct Messages" button with a "ghosty counter" (depressing)(similar to the friend request notifications)
- actually understand what i'm doing and make it finally coherent
- ran out of ideas
